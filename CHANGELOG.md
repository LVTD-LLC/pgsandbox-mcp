# Changelog

- Moved the two published site blog posts out of Rowset and into Astro-managed Markdown content files.

- Added the initial SEO content foundation with brand guidance, Rowset blog configuration, internal link inventory, keyword research baseline, and candidate backlog for future PGSandbox MCP blog posts.

## 2026-06-19

- Hardened the Astro site build by pinning Node 24.15.0 and upgrading to Astro 6 with explicit `overrides` for patched transitive build tooling: `esbuild`, `volar-service-yaml`, `yaml-language-server`, and `yaml`.
