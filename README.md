# PGSandbox MCP

Safe disposable Postgres databases for coding agents.

PGSandbox is a local MCP server that gives agents a narrow, tracked way to create, use, and clean up real Postgres databases. Agents could improvise this with `psql`, `createdb`, and shell scripts. PGSandbox exists so they do not have to improvise with admin credentials every time.

It works against Postgres you already control: a local install, a container-local Postgres, a VPS, or a private development database host. It does not install Postgres or require Docker.
Postgres URL `sslmode` settings are honored, so remote profiles can require TLS with `sslmode=require`.

## Why This Exists

Agents need real databases to validate migrations, reproduce backend bugs, test generated SQL, and build seeded demo states. Without a guardrail, the usual options are risky:

- hand an agent shared development credentials
- let it invent database create/drop commands in a shell
- keep stale test databases around after interrupted sessions
- skip database verification because setup is annoying

PGSandbox makes the safe path shorter:

- create one database and one scoped login role per task
- clone an existing Postgres source into a tracked sandbox when realistic data matters
- record every sandbox in metadata before it can be cleaned up
- run SQL through the sandbox role, not the admin connection
- cap TTLs and delete expired resources
- drop only databases PGSandbox created for the selected profile
- return bounded query results instead of dumping unbounded rows

The value is not that agents cannot use Postgres by themselves. The value is that database lifecycle becomes explicit, auditable, and disposable by default.

## Install

If you want your coding agent to install and configure PGSandbox for you, copy
this prompt into the agent:

```text
Install and configure PGSandbox MCP on this machine.

PGSandbox MCP is a local stdio MCP server for disposable Postgres databases. It
needs an existing Postgres admin connection that can create databases and roles.
It does not install Postgres and does not require Docker.

Do the following:
1. Detect my OS, shell, available package managers, and MCP client. Supported
   clients are codex, cursor, vscode, claude-desktop, and all. If this session
   is clearly running inside one supported MCP client, configure that client
   without asking. If several clients are installed, prefer the active client and
   ask only if you cannot infer where config should be written.
2. Install pgsandbox-mcp. Prefer:
   brew install LVTD-LLC/tap/pgsandbox-mcp
   If Homebrew is unavailable, use:
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox-mcp/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
   If the install script uses ~/.local/bin, make sure pgsandbox-mcp is available
   in the current shell PATH before continuing.
3. Run:
   pgsandbox-mcp --version
   If another pgsandbox-mcp appears earlier in PATH and is missing, broken, or a
   different version, use the absolute path to the healthy installed binary in
   the setup command with --command.
4. Find a usable Postgres admin URL with no user interaction. Try, in order:
   - existing PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL or PGSANDBOX_CONFIG values
   - existing local MCP configs that already contain a pgsandbox admin URL
   - running Docker, OrbStack, Colima, or Podman Postgres containers and exposed
     ports; derive local URLs from container port mappings and POSTGRES_USER,
     POSTGRES_PASSWORD, and POSTGRES_DB metadata when available
   - passwordless local libpq candidates with psql -w over Unix sockets and
     localhost for the current user and postgres user against postgres/template1
   - local .pg_service.conf, .pgpass, and project env files, without printing
     file contents. Use explicit PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL values as
     candidates. For all other file-sourced candidates, including
     .pg_service.conf, .pgpass, DATABASE_URL, POSTGRES_URL, and POSTGRES_*,
     proceed without asking only when the parsed or resolved host is clearly
     local: localhost, 127.0.0.1, ::1, a Unix socket, or a container port you
     just discovered. Do not validate or configure non-local file-sourced
     database credentials silently.
   Validate candidates with `pgsandbox-mcp doctor --admin-url "$CANDIDATE_URL"`.
   When possible, also verify the role can create databases and roles, or is a
   superuser. If one valid explicit PGSANDBOX_* candidate or clearly local
   candidate is found, export it as PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL for this setup
   and continue without asking me. Tell me which source you used and the URL
   with the password masked, for example postgres://user:***@host/db. Ask me
   for a URL only after all discovery paths fail or the only remaining
   candidates are non-local file-sourced database credentials, and briefly say
   what you checked.
5. Configure the MCP client:
   pgsandbox-mcp setup --client <client> --admin-url "$PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL"
   Use --scope project for Cursor or VS Code only if I ask for project-local
   config. Otherwise use the default user scope.
6. Verify configuration and Postgres connectivity:
   pgsandbox-mcp doctor --admin-url "$PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL"
   If this fails, explain whether the CLI, MCP config, or Postgres connection
   failed.
7. Run the disposable end-to-end check:
   pgsandbox-mcp smoke-test --admin-url "$PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL"
   This should create, query, and delete a sandbox database.
8. Tell me exactly which MCP client config was updated and that I need to restart
   the MCP client. After restart, help me verify that the pgsandbox server is
   available.

Constraints:
- Do not install, start, or modify Postgres unless I explicitly ask.
- Default to discovery and execution. Do not ask for confirmation before using a
  discovered explicit PGSANDBOX_* URL or local Postgres admin URL that passes
  validation. Ask before using any non-local database credential sourced from
  .pg_service.conf, .pgpass, DATABASE_URL, POSTGRES_URL, or POSTGRES_* values.
- Do not inline the full admin URL in commands, docs, git-tracked files, shell
  startup files, or summaries. Use "$PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL" in commands.
  The MCP setup command may write the admin URL only to the selected local MCP
  client config.
- Do not leave a smoke-test database behind. If cleanup fails, report the
  database id or name so I can delete it.
```

The intended local install is a native binary through Homebrew:

```bash
brew install LVTD-LLC/tap/pgsandbox-mcp
pgsandbox-mcp setup --client codex --admin-url postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
pgsandbox-mcp doctor
```

The Homebrew formula lives in [LVTD-LLC/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/LVTD-LLC/homebrew-tap). Homebrew exposes that repo as the `LVTD-LLC/tap` tap.

Restart the MCP client after setup. In Codex, run `/mcp` to verify the `pgsandbox` server is available.

If you do not use Homebrew, install the latest GitHub release binary with the
hosted installer:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox-mcp/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
pgsandbox-mcp setup --client codex --admin-url postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
pgsandbox-mcp doctor
```

The installer downloads a platform-specific release archive, verifies the
checksum when the release includes `pgsandbox-mcp-<version>-checksums.txt`, and
installs to `~/.local/bin` by default. Use `PGSANDBOX_VERSION=0.1.0` to pin a
release or `PGSANDBOX_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin` to choose a different install
directory.

For development from this repo:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run -- setup --client codex --admin-url postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
cargo run -- smoke-test --admin-url postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres
```

Rust users can also install directly from GitHub:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox-mcp --tag v0.1.0
```

## Update

The CLI binary is also the MCP server process. To update both, update the
installed `pgsandbox-mcp` binary, refresh the MCP client entry if the command,
admin URL, or target client changed, then restart the MCP client.

With Homebrew:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade LVTD-LLC/tap/pgsandbox-mcp
pgsandbox-mcp --version
pgsandbox-mcp setup --client codex --admin-url "$PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL"
pgsandbox-mcp doctor
```

With the GitHub install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox-mcp/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
pgsandbox-mcp --version
pgsandbox-mcp setup --client codex --admin-url "$PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL"
pgsandbox-mcp doctor
```

If you installed to a custom path, keep the MCP client pointed at that binary:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox-mcp/main/scripts/install.sh | PGSANDBOX_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
pgsandbox-mcp setup --client codex --command /usr/local/bin/pgsandbox-mcp --admin-url "$PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL"
```

If you installed from source, rebuild and reinstall:

```bash
cargo install --path . --force
# or, from GitHub:
cargo install --git https://github.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox-mcp --tag v0.1.0 --force
```

Rerunning `setup` updates the local MCP client config in place and preserves
unrelated MCP servers. Restart the MCP client after updating; in Codex, run
`/mcp` after restart to verify the `pgsandbox` server is available.

## MCP Client Setup

The setup command writes the right MCP config shape for each supported client:

```bash
pgsandbox-mcp setup --client codex --admin-url "$PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL"
pgsandbox-mcp setup --client cursor --scope project --admin-url "$PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL"
pgsandbox-mcp setup --client vscode --scope project --admin-url "$PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL"
pgsandbox-mcp setup --client claude-desktop --admin-url "$PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL"
pgsandbox-mcp setup --client all --admin-url "$PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL"
```

Supported targets:

- Codex: `~/.codex/config.toml` or project `.codex/config.toml`
- Cursor: `~/.cursor/mcp.json` or project `.cursor/mcp.json`
- VS Code: user `mcp.json` or project `.vscode/mcp.json`
- Claude Desktop: `claude_desktop_config.json`

Use `--dry-run` to print the config without writing files. Passing `--admin-url` writes the admin database URL into the MCP client config so desktop clients do not depend on shell startup files.

## Configuration

The fastest setup is one admin connection string:

```bash
export PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL="postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"
pgsandbox-mcp
```

For multiple Postgres versions or hosts, use profiles:

```json
{
  "defaultProfile": "local-pg17",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "local-pg17",
      "adminUrl": "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres",
      "databasePrefix": "pgsandbox",
      "defaultTtlMinutes": 240,
      "maxTtlMinutes": 1440
    },
    {
      "name": "local-pg16",
      "adminUrl": "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/postgres"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then run:

```bash
export PGSANDBOX_CONFIG="./pgsandbox.config.json"
pgsandbox-mcp
```

## Telemetry

PGSandbox sends anonymous usage telemetry to PostHog so the project can see
which CLI commands and MCP tools are used, whether they succeed, and how long
they take. Telemetry is enabled by default and never blocks the CLI or MCP tool
result.

Telemetry uses a random local installation id and sends personless PostHog
events. It does not send Postgres URLs, connection strings, database names or
ids, SQL text, owner values, label keys or values, full file paths, or error
messages.

Disable telemetry with any of:

```bash
export PGSANDBOX_TELEMETRY=false
export PGSANDBOX_NO_TELEMETRY=1
export PGSANDBOX_DISABLE_TELEMETRY=1
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```

When using `PGSANDBOX_CONFIG`, telemetry can also be disabled in JSON:

```json
{
  "defaultProfile": "local-pg17",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "local-pg17",
      "adminUrl": "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres"
    }
  ],
  "telemetry": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

## MCP Tools

V0 supports:

- `create_database`
- `clone_database`
- `delete_database`
- `get_connection_string`
- `run_sql`
- `describe_schema`
- `list_databases`
- `cleanup_expired`

See [docs/mcp-tools.md](docs/mcp-tools.md) for details.

## Local Shape

The service uses:

- Rust native binary
- `rmcp` stdio MCP server
- Postgres admin connection with permission to create databases and roles
- metadata table for ownership, TTL, encrypted sandbox credentials, and cleanup state
- optional `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` on `PATH` for `clone_database`
- optional Docker Compose only for local demo Postgres

Start with [docker-compose.example.yml](docker-compose.example.yml) only if you do not already have local Postgres running.

The MCP server runs over stdio:

```bash
pgsandbox-mcp
# or explicitly
pgsandbox-mcp stdio
```

## Development

```bash
cargo check
cargo test
cargo build --release
npm run site:build
```

Release packaging check:

```bash
npm run package:homebrew
npm run package:release
```

Upload the generated release archives and checksum file before publishing the
GitHub release. When the release is published,
`.github/workflows/update-homebrew-tap.yml` opens a PR against
[LVTD-LLC/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/LVTD-LLC/homebrew-tap) with the
immutable release URL and SHA256 for `Formula/pgsandbox-mcp.rb`.

The workflow requires a repository secret named `HOMEBREW_TAP_PAT`. Use a
fine-grained token with `Contents: Read and write` and `Pull requests: Read and
write` access to `LVTD-LLC/homebrew-tap`, or an equivalent classic PAT.

## Safety Rules

- All databases have explicit TTLs.
- Generated role names and database names use a predictable prefix.
- Agent-created users are not superusers.
- Destructive tools only operate on resources created by this MCP.
- Admin connections are used for lifecycle and metadata only.
- User SQL runs through generated sandbox credentials.
- Sandbox role passwords are encrypted before being stored in metadata.
- Connection strings are returned only to the caller and are not logged in full.
- The service should run locally or on a private network, not as a public internet-exposed admin surface.

## Status

Early v0. Treat this as local/private infrastructure until the MCP surface and cleanup semantics have more mileage.
