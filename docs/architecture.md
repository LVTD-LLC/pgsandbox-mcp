# Architecture Notes

## V0 Design

The first version is a local Rust MCP server in front of one default
PGSandbox-managed local Postgres cluster plus optional explicit external
Postgres admin profiles. It does not require Docker and should never bind or
modify a developer's existing Postgres service on `localhost:5432`.
For remote Postgres profiles, the configured Postgres URL can require TLS with
`sslmode=require`.

This local-first shape is the current deployment boundary, not the permanent
product ceiling. A future hosted PGSandbox database platform should preserve
the same agent workflow while adding managed compute, auth, tenancy, quotas,
billing, and faster clone/fork backends.

```text
Agent / MCP client
        |
        v
PGSandbox MCP
        |
        v
Managed local cluster or explicit Postgres profile
        |
        v
Task-specific databases and roles
```

The MCP server owns all database lifecycle metadata in an internal table:

- database id
- profile name
- database name
- role name
- encrypted role password
- owner agent/session
- purpose
- labels
- created timestamp
- expiry timestamp
- deleted timestamp

Lifecycle events are also recorded in an internal audit table with event type,
database id/name, profile, role name, timestamp, and small JSON details. The
audit table does not store admin URLs or sandbox connection strings.

## Resource Model

Each experiment gets:

- one database
- one login role
- credentials scoped to that database
- a TTL
- optional labels for task, repo, branch, or agent

Cloned experiments follow the same resource model. The source database is read
through a supplied source connection string or a future source profile, and the
destination is still a PGSandbox-created database and role recorded in
metadata.

Generated names should be deterministic enough to audit but random enough to avoid collisions:

```text
pgsandbox_<slug>_<short_id>
```

The admin connection is used only for lifecycle operations. Tool calls that run user SQL connect using the generated sandbox role.
Sandbox role passwords are encrypted before being persisted in the metadata table; existing plaintext metadata rows remain readable for compatibility.

## Telemetry

The local server sends anonymous PostHog events for CLI command completion,
MCP server startup, and MCP tool completion. The events are usage-level only:
tool or command names, version, OS/architecture, success, elapsed time, and
small booleans or counts such as `dryRun`, `readonly`, and label count.

Telemetry must not include Postgres URLs, connection strings, database names or
ids, SQL text, owner values, label keys or values, full local paths, or raw
error messages. Users can disable telemetry with environment variables or with
`"telemetry": { "enabled": false }` in `PGSANDBOX_CONFIG`.

## Managed Local Runtime

When no `PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL` or `PGSANDBOX_CONFIG` is set, startup
initializes and starts a local Postgres cluster under `~/.pgsandbox/postgres`.
The runtime stores its private config at `~/.pgsandbox/local-postgres.json`,
including the selected port, data directory, Unix socket directory, log file,
and admin URL. CLI output masks the admin URL password.

The local runtime starts at port `65432` and scans upward for a free high port,
so a Docker container or developer database on `5432` is not disturbed. It also
sets `unix_socket_directories` to a PGSandbox-owned run directory for local
socket access by Postgres tools.

## Profiles

Profiles are the opt-in mechanism for supporting external Postgres versions or
hosts instead of the managed local default. Local loopback profiles are allowed
by default. A non-local admin URL requires an explicit opt-in through
`allowExternalAdminUrl` or an `allowedAdminHosts` entry, and profiles can cap
active databases per owner.

Example:

```json
{
  "defaultProfile": "external-pg17",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "name": "external-pg17",
      "adminUrl": "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:6543/postgres",
      "maxActiveDatabasesPerOwner": 3
    },
    {
      "name": "external-pg16",
      "adminUrl": "postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:6544/postgres"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Cleanup

Cleanup can run in two ways:

- explicit MCP tool: `cleanup_expired`
- scheduled process: cron or long-running interval inside the service

Cleanup should only delete databases listed in the metadata table and matching the configured prefix.

## Schema Snapshots

Schema snapshots are explicit named checkpoints stored under PG Sandbox's local
state directory, not inside the application repo and not in the admin database.
Each snapshot records:

- profile and sandbox id
- snapshot name
- creation time
- owner/purpose/labels copied from sandbox metadata
- Postgres version
- schema digest version
- object counts and compact object fingerprints

Snapshots are deliberately manual. They are useful for "before migration" or
"known good" comparison points, but they are not refreshed automatically and
should not be treated as current truth after later database changes.

## Local Templates

Templates are local `pg_dump` artifacts plus JSON metadata under PG Sandbox's
managed state directory. A template can only be created from a live
PGSandbox-owned sandbox found in metadata. Restoring a template creates a fresh
tracked sandbox with its own role, TTL, owner, and labels.

This is intentionally a simple local reuse layer for agent QA loops after
migrations and seeds. It is not copy-on-write forking, DBLab, filesystem
snapshotting, hosted branching, or a production-data import workflow.

## Cloning And Future Branching Backends

The first cloning backend should favor portability and clarity:

- create an empty sandbox database and scoped role
- run `pg_dump` against the source database with ownership and privileges omitted
- stream the dump into `pg_restore` connected as the sandbox role
- delete the destination sandbox if the clone fails

This requires `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` for cloning and template tools. Normal
empty sandbox creation on the managed local runtime requires `initdb`,
`pg_ctl`, and `postgres`, but it should continue to work without dump/restore
tools.

If `pg_dump`/`pg_restore` becomes too slow for large seeded states, evaluate a
branching backend:

- DBLab Engine
- stagDB
- Neon OSS
- filesystem snapshots on a dedicated Postgres host

The MCP contract should stay mostly the same. The backend can later learn `fork_database` or `create_from_snapshot`.
