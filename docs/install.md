# Install And Setup

PGSandbox is distributed as a native Rust binary with both direct CLI commands
and an MCP stdio mode. By default, it manages a local Postgres cluster under
`~/.pgsandbox/` and chooses a high local port such as `127.0.0.1:65432`,
leaving Docker or another developer database on `5432` untouched.

The managed local runtime requires `initdb`, `pg_ctl`, and `postgres`. The
`setup` command checks for those binaries, installs PostgreSQL with a supported
package manager when they are missing and one is available, initializes and
starts the managed local cluster, then writes MCP client config. PGSandbox also
checks `PATH`, common package-manager and Postgres.app install locations such
as `/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql/bin`, `/usr/lib/postgresql/<major>/bin`, and
versioned Homebrew locations from `postgresql@18` through `postgresql@13`, plus
explicit bin directory environment variables. The `clone_database` MCP tool
additionally requires `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` because it restores a source
database dump into a new sandbox.

## Agent-Assisted Setup

Copy this prompt into your coding agent if you want it to install and configure
PGSandbox for you:

```text
Install and configure PGSandbox on this machine.

PGSandbox is a local CLI and stdio MCP server for disposable Postgres
databases. It uses a PGSandbox-managed local Postgres cluster by default. The setup command
checks for local Postgres server binaries such as `initdb`, `pg_ctl`, and
`postgres`, installs PostgreSQL through a supported package manager when
possible, and does not use Docker or touch any existing Postgres service on
port 5432.

Do the following:
1. Detect my OS, shell, available package managers, and MCP client. Supported
   clients are codex, cursor, vscode, claude-desktop, and all. If this session
   is clearly running inside one supported MCP client, configure that client
   without asking. If several clients are installed, prefer the active client and
   ask only if you cannot infer where config should be written.
2. Install pgsandbox. Prefer:
   brew install LVTD-LLC/tap/pgsandbox
   If Homebrew is unavailable, use:
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
   If the install script uses ~/.local/bin, make sure pgsandbox is available
   in the current shell PATH before continuing.
3. Run:
   pgsandbox --version
   If another pgsandbox appears earlier in PATH and is missing, broken, or a
   different version, use the absolute path to the healthy installed binary in
   the setup command with --command.
4. Configure the MCP client without an admin URL unless I explicitly gave one:
   pgsandbox setup --client <client>
   Let setup check/start the managed local runtime. If PostgreSQL server
   binaries are missing and a supported package manager is available, setup
   should install them. If setup cannot install them automatically, explain the
   exact package-manager or `PGSANDBOX_POSTGRES_BIN_DIR` action needed. Do not
   start Docker, stop Docker containers, or bind `localhost:5432`.
   Use --scope project for Cursor or VS Code only if I ask for project-local
   config. Otherwise use the default user scope.
5. Verify configuration and Postgres connectivity:
   pgsandbox doctor
   If this fails, explain whether the CLI, local Postgres runtime, MCP config,
   or explicit external Postgres connection failed.
6. Run the disposable end-to-end check:
   pgsandbox smoke-test
   This should create, query, and delete a sandbox database.
7. If the active agent prefers CLI commands instead of MCP tools, verify direct
   CLI access with:
   pgsandbox create-database --name-hint cli-check --ttl-minutes 10
   pgsandbox run-sql --database-id <created-id> --sql "select 1" --readonly
   pgsandbox delete-database --database-id <created-id>
8. Tell me exactly which MCP client config was updated and that I need to restart
   the MCP client. After restart, help me verify that the pgsandbox server is
   available.

Constraints:
- Do not run Docker commands, stop Docker containers, bind `localhost:5432`, or
  mutate an existing developer database.
- Use the managed local cluster by default. Use `PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL`,
  `PGSANDBOX_CONFIG`, or `--admin-url` only when I explicitly ask for an
  external profile.
- Do not inline the full admin URL in commands, docs, git-tracked files, shell
  startup files, or summaries. Local runtime output should mask the password and
  point to `~/.pgsandbox/local-postgres.json` for the full private URL.
- Do not leave a smoke-test database behind. If cleanup fails, report the
  database id or name so I can delete it.
```

## Homebrew

```bash
brew install LVTD-LLC/tap/pgsandbox
pgsandbox setup --client codex
```

This uses the [LVTD-LLC/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/LVTD-LLC/homebrew-tap) repository, which Homebrew addresses as `LVTD-LLC/tap`.
If PostgreSQL server binaries are missing, `setup` installs PostgreSQL through
a supported package manager before starting the managed local runtime.

## GitHub Install Script

For users who do not use Homebrew:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
pgsandbox setup --client codex
```

The installer fetches the latest GitHub release for the current OS and CPU,
installs `pgsandbox` to `~/.local/bin`, and verifies checksums when the
release includes `pgsandbox-<version>-checksums.txt`. The install script
installs the PGSandbox binary; `pgsandbox setup` owns the local Postgres
runtime check/start flow after that.

Pin a version or install somewhere else with environment variables:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox/main/scripts/install.sh | PGSANDBOX_VERSION=0.1.3 sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox/main/scripts/install.sh | PGSANDBOX_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
```

## Install From Source For Development

Normal users should prefer Homebrew or the GitHub release installer above.
Source installs are for contribution work, testing a local checkout, or
validating unreleased changes.

```bash
cargo install --path .
pgsandbox setup --client codex
```

From GitHub without cloning first:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox --tag v0.1.3
pgsandbox setup --client codex
```

## Update

The installed CLI binary is the MCP server process that clients launch. Updating
the CLI and restarting the MCP client updates the server. Rerun `setup` when the
binary path, explicit admin URL, selected client, or scope changes.

For Homebrew and GitHub install-script installs, the shortest path is:

```bash
pgsandbox upgrade
```

`upgrade` updates the installed binary, reruns `setup --client all`, runs
`doctor`, and reminds you to restart MCP clients. It supports the same release
targets as the GitHub installer: macOS and Linux on `x86_64` or `aarch64`.
Homebrew installs are upgraded through Homebrew. GitHub install-script installs
rerun the hosted installer into the current binary directory. `--version` is
only supported for GitHub install-script installs because Homebrew upgrades use
the tap formula version.

Use these options to narrow or skip post-upgrade work, or pin a GitHub
installer release:

```bash
pgsandbox upgrade --setup codex
pgsandbox upgrade --no-setup
pgsandbox upgrade --no-doctor
pgsandbox upgrade --version 0.4.7
```

Homebrew can only upgrade after a newer GitHub release exists and the
`LVTD-LLC/homebrew-tap` formula has been updated. If `brew upgrade
LVTD-LLC/tap/pgsandbox` says the current version is already installed, the
tap does not have a newer version yet.

With Homebrew:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade LVTD-LLC/tap/pgsandbox
pgsandbox --version
pgsandbox setup --client codex
pgsandbox doctor
```

If `pgsandbox --version` prints a Node.js stack trace or references
`dist/index.js`, another install is shadowing the Homebrew binary. Check the
resolution order:

```bash
which -a pgsandbox
/opt/homebrew/bin/pgsandbox --version
```

Remove the stale npm/global install or point the MCP client at the native
binary explicitly:

```bash
npm uninstall -g pgsandbox
hash -r 2>/dev/null || rehash
pgsandbox setup --client codex --command /opt/homebrew/bin/pgsandbox
```

With the GitHub install script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
pgsandbox --version
pgsandbox setup --client codex
pgsandbox doctor
```

For a custom install directory, reinstall there and keep the MCP config pointed
at the same binary:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox/main/scripts/install.sh | PGSANDBOX_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
pgsandbox setup --client codex --command /usr/local/bin/pgsandbox
```

From source:

```bash
cargo install --path . --force
# or, from GitHub:
cargo install --git https://github.com/LVTD-LLC/pgsandbox --tag v<VERSION> --force
```

Replace `v<VERSION>` with the release tag you want to install.

Rerunning `setup` updates the existing local MCP config entry and preserves
unrelated MCP servers. Restart the MCP client after updating; in Codex, run
`/mcp` after restart to verify the `pgsandbox` server is available.

For maintainers publishing a new version: bump the package version, publish a
GitHub release with the generated archives, wait for the `Update Homebrew tap`
workflow to open a PR in `LVTD-LLC/homebrew-tap`, and merge that tap PR before
telling Homebrew users to run `brew upgrade`.

## Supported Clients

```bash
pgsandbox setup --client codex
pgsandbox setup --client cursor --scope project
pgsandbox setup --client vscode --scope project
pgsandbox setup --client claude-desktop
pgsandbox setup --client all
```

## Verify

```bash
pgsandbox doctor
pgsandbox smoke-test
```

Then restart your MCP client and ask it to create a disposable Postgres sandbox.

## No-Docker Quickstart

PGSandbox does not need Docker and does not bind `localhost:5432` by default.
This check is safe to run while Docker or another developer Postgres is already
using port `5432`:

```bash
pgsandbox local start
pgsandbox doctor
pgsandbox smoke-test
```

The local runtime should report its selected high port, usually `65432` or the
next free port. If `smoke-test` passes, PGSandbox created, queried, and deleted
a disposable database without touching the service on `5432`.

## MCP Config Examples

Use the current native binary command in client configs. The `setup` command
writes these shapes automatically, but `--dry-run` is useful when reviewing
what will change.

```bash
pgsandbox setup --client codex --dry-run
pgsandbox setup --client claude-desktop --dry-run
pgsandbox setup --client cursor --scope project --dry-run
pgsandbox setup --client vscode --scope project --dry-run
```

Codex and user-scoped setup are usually the shortest path:

```bash
pgsandbox setup --client codex
```

Cursor and VS Code can use project scope when the repo should carry the MCP
entry:

```bash
pgsandbox setup --client cursor --scope project
pgsandbox setup --client vscode --scope project
```

Only pass `--admin-url` when intentionally opting into an external Postgres
profile. The default setup uses the managed local cluster.

To make the MCP client default to a specific installed local Postgres major
version, pass `--postgres-version` during setup:

```bash
pgsandbox setup --client codex --postgres-version 18
```

To install missing local server binaries first when your system package manager
can provide the requested major, use `ensure-postgres`:

```bash
pgsandbox ensure-postgres --postgres-version 13
pgsandbox setup --client codex --postgres-version 13
```

Agents can do the same from MCP by calling `ensure_postgres`:

```json
{ "postgresVersion": "13", "installMissing": true }
```

Automatic PostgreSQL package installs use Homebrew on macOS; `apt-get`, `dnf`,
`yum`, `zypper`, or `pacman` on Linux; and WinGet or Chocolatey on Windows.
Versioned packages still depend on what that package manager currently
publishes.

You can also start or inspect a versioned local cluster directly:

```bash
pgsandbox local start --postgres-version 18 --install-missing
pgsandbox local status --postgres-version 18
```

PGSandbox keeps each requested major version in separate local state, such as
`~/.pgsandbox/postgres/versions/18/`, and uses profile names like `local-pg18`.
It discovers binaries from `PATH`, common package-manager locations,
`PGSANDBOX_POSTGRES_BIN_DIR`, or `PGSANDBOX_POSTGRES_18_BIN_DIR`. Common-path
version discovery includes installed Postgres 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, and 13
binaries.

## Repo Workflow Recipe

After installation and MCP restart, an agent can validate a repo migration
workflow without using the developer's real database:

1. Call `create_database` with a short `nameHint`, owner, labels, and positive
   TTL.
2. Optionally call `prepare_for_repo` with the repo path, sandbox id, and an
   explicit `migrationCommand` argv array to store reusable workflow metadata.
3. Call `validate_schema_change` with the same repo path, sandbox id, and either an
   explicit command or the configured `migrationCommand`.
4. Optionally call `seed_database` with an explicit seed command argv array.
5. Save a checkpoint with `create_schema_snapshot` or create a reusable local
   template with `create_template_from_sandbox`.

`prepare_for_repo` writes `.pgsandbox/project.json` without secrets. Migration
and seed tools run commands without a shell, inject the sandbox URL through
environment variables, and return bounded stdout/stderr. If the repo has a
Compose or devcontainer Postgres image such as `postgres:16`, `prepare_for_repo`
records that version so later workflow calls can use the matching local profile.

PGSandbox does not ship framework adapters. Agents should choose the appropriate
repo command for the task and pass it as a short argv array.

## Troubleshooting

- Missing `initdb`, `pg_ctl`, or `postgres`: rerun
  `pgsandbox setup --client <client>` first. Setup checks `PATH`, common
  package-manager locations, Postgres.app, and explicit bin dir environment
  variables; when a supported package manager is available it installs
  PostgreSQL for you before starting the managed local runtime. If setup cannot
  install automatically, install local PostgreSQL server binaries with your
  system package manager or set
  `PGSANDBOX_POSTGRES_BIN_DIR`.
- Missing a requested Postgres version: install that version locally or set
  `PGSANDBOX_POSTGRES_<major>_BIN_DIR`, for example
  `PGSANDBOX_POSTGRES_13_BIN_DIR=/opt/homebrew/opt/postgresql@13/bin`.
- Missing `pg_dump` or `pg_restore`: install PostgreSQL client tools before
  using `clone_database` or template tools.
- Occupied local ports: run `pgsandbox local start`; the managed runtime
  scans upward from `65432` and does not take over `5432`.
- Old managed-local socket path after upgrade: TCP connections continue to work,
  but Unix-socket consumers should run `pgsandbox local stop` and then
  `pgsandbox local start` to move the live socket under
  `/tmp/pgsandbox-sockets/`.
- Stale MCP admin URL: rerun `pgsandbox setup --client <client>` without
  `--admin-url`, restart the MCP client, and rerun `pgsandbox doctor`.
- Permissions under `~/.pgsandbox`: check ownership of the directory or set
  `PGSANDBOX_HOME` to a writable local path.
- Stale sandboxes: call `list_databases`, then `delete_database` for specific
  sandboxes or `cleanup_expired` for expired ones.
- External DB safety refusals: `PGSANDBOX_ADMIN_DATABASE_URL`,
  `PGSANDBOX_CONFIG`, and `--admin-url` are explicit opt-ins. Verify the host
  and profile are intended for local/private development.

## npm/npx Status

Public npm/npx publishing is intentionally deferred. The supported install paths
today are the native binary through Homebrew, the GitHub install script, and
source install. Do not rely on `npx pgsandbox` unless a later release
decision explicitly defines the package name, auth/release process, and binary
packaging.
