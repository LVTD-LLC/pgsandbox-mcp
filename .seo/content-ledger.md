| --- | ---: | --- | --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 18 | Definition / guide | What Is a Database Sandbox? | database sandbox | 90 | 15 | Informational | Results skew broad and mixed across vendor docs, online sandboxes, and educational material. | Good category-creation page, but slightly less direct than Postgres/MCP queries and broader intent may dilute conversion. |
| 2 | 16 | Tutorial | How to Create a Test Postgres Database for Agent-Generated SQL | postgres test database | 20 | 2 | Informational | Low-volume long-tail with practical developer intent. | Very winnable, but lower ceiling. Good future support piece for migration validation. |

## Notes

- Keyword data source: DataForSEO Google keyword overview and suggestions, United States / English, pulled 2026-06-29.
- SERP read source: web search fallback on 2026-06-29 because DataForSEO live SERP endpoint disconnected repeatedly from this environment.
- Treat `postgres mcp server` and `mcp postgres` as related but not identical: the former is broader informational discovery; the latter appears navigational and may skew toward specific registries/repos.
